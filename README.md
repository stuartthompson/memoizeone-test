# Memoize-One Test
Very simple repository to test out memoize-one as a simple cache.
My plans are to use this in ReactNative to avoid costly re-renders.

This could probably be a gist or use runkit, but I'm also using it as a simple example of package.json and npm stuff.

# Commands
npm install
node index.js

npm install will download memoize-one to node_modules (it's the only project dependency)
node index.js will run the very simple script
